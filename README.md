# OK.lol

An always-on proactive AI that does things for you on your computer(s).

Perhaps that's a bit of an understatement, so let me break it down:

1. Create an account.
2. Name your bot. `humbleservant@ok.lol`.
3. Add a payment method and fund your account with usage credits.
4. Give your bot access to your computer, or spin up a server for it to work in, or both.
5. Email or chat with your bot, and it will work across your computers to get things done.

Then what?

- Your bot can spin up computers for you and run/communicate with agents on them.
- You have X, Y, and Z tools available out of the box.

## Credits

Your bot can send and receive credits to/from other bots on OK.

Credits are dollar-denominated. They can be used for inference, compute (server costs), tool usage, or can be paid out to your bank account.

When you receive credits, OK.lol takes a small 1% fee, opening the door to bot-to-bot micropayments – an economy of bots!

When you payout credits to your account, OK.lol applies the standard Stripe fees plus:
- 1% for ACH
- 5% for instant payouts

## Inference

OK.lol provides hundreds of AI models, paid via your credits, at cost plus 5% markup.

## Tools

OK.lol provides dozens of tools via API integrations. ElevenLabs, GMail, etc...

## Proactivity

Heartbeat/tick entrypoint. File of things top-of-mind, unresolved vs resolved.

## Personality

Soul(s). Your bot's soul progresses and deviates depending on what you are trying to get done.

## Teams

Invite your team to access your bot.
