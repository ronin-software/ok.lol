## Management API

The management API runs on the root path and is used to list, create, and look up actors.

### Authentication

| Environment | Authentication |
|---|---|
| **Local development** | No authentication required. All endpoints are accessible without tokens. |
| **Self-hosted engine** | The Rivet Engine handles authentication. Set `RIVET_TOKEN` to enable authenticated access to restricted endpoints like KV. |
| **Rivet Cloud** | Authentication is handled by the Rivet Cloud platform. Use your project token passed via the `x-rivet-token` header. |

Restricted endpoints (like KV reads) require the `x-rivet-token` header:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/actors/{actor_id}/kv/keys/{base64_key} \
  -H 'x-rivet-token: YOUR_RIVET_TOKEN'
```

### List Actors

```bash
# List all actors with a given name
curl http://localhost:6420/actors?name=my-actor

# List actors by key
curl http://localhost:6420/actors?key=my-key

# List actors by IDs (comma-separated)
curl http://localhost:6420/actors?actor_ids=id1,id2
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "actors": [
    {
      "actor_id": "abc123",
      "name": "my-actor",
      "key": "[\"default\"]",
      "namespace_id": "default",
      "create_ts": 1706000000000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create or Get Actor

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:6420/actors \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-actor",
    "key": "[\"default\"]",
    "runner_name_selector": "default",
    "crash_policy": "restart"
  }'
```

Returns the actor object with its `actor_id`.

### List Actor Names

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/actors/names?namespace=default
```

Returns all registered actor names and their metadata.

### Read Actor KV

Requires authentication (see above).

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/actors/{actor_id}/kv/keys/{base64_key} \
  -H 'x-rivet-token: YOUR_RIVET_TOKEN'
```

Returns the value stored at the given key.

See the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/rivetkit-openapi) for the full schema of all management endpoints.

## Actor API

All actor-level endpoints are accessed through the gateway. The gateway routes requests to the correct actor instance using the actor ID in the URL path:

```
http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/{path}
```

The gateway only accepts actor IDs, not names. Use `GET /actors?name=...` from the management API to look up actor IDs first.

### Authentication

Standard actor endpoints (health, actions, requests) and inspector endpoints have separate authentication requirements.

#### Standard Endpoints

| Environment | Authentication |
|---|---|
| **Local development** | No authentication required. |
| **Self-hosted engine** | The Rivet Engine handles authentication at the gateway level. |
| **Rivet Cloud** | Authentication is handled by the Rivet Cloud platform at the gateway level. |

#### Inspector Endpoints

| Environment | Authentication |
|---|---|
| **Local development** | No authentication required if `RIVET_INSPECTOR_TOKEN` is not set. A warning is logged. |
| **Self-hosted engine** | Set the `RIVET_INSPECTOR_TOKEN` environment variable. Pass it as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. |
| **Rivet Cloud** | Token is required. Pass it as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. |

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/summary \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_INSPECTOR_TOKEN'
```

### Standard Actor Endpoints

These are the built-in actor endpoints available through the gateway:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/health

# Call an action
curl -X POST http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/action/myAction \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"args": [1, 2, 3]}'

# Forward an HTTP request to the actor's onRequest handler
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/request/my/custom/path
```

### Inspector Endpoints

The inspector HTTP API exposes JSON endpoints for querying and modifying actor internals at runtime. These are designed for agent-based debugging and tooling.

#### Get State

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/state
```

Returns the actor's current persisted state:

```json
{ "state": { "count": 42, "users": [] } }
```

#### Set State

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/state \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"state": {"count": 0, "users": []}}'
```

Returns:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

#### Get Connections

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/connections
```

Returns all active connections with their params, state, and metadata:

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "type": "websocket",
      "id": "conn-id",
      "details": {
        "type": "websocket",
        "params": {},
        "stateEnabled": true,
        "state": {},
        "subscriptions": 2,
        "isHibernatable": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Get RPCs

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/rpcs
```

Returns a list of available actions:

```json
{ "rpcs": ["increment", "getCount"] }
```

#### Execute Action

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/action/increment \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"args": [5]}'
```

Returns:

```json
{ "output": 47 }
```

#### Get Queue Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/queue?limit=10
```

Returns queue status with messages:

```json
{
  "size": 3,
  "maxSize": 1000,
  "truncated": false,
  "messages": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "process", "createdAtMs": 1706000000000 }
  ]
}
```

#### Get Traces

Query trace spans in OTLP JSON format:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/traces?startMs=0&endMs=9999999999999&limit=100"
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "otlp": {
    "resourceSpans": [
      {
        "scopeSpans": [
          {
            "spans": [
              {
                "traceId": "abc123",
                "spanId": "def456",
                "name": "increment",
                "startTimeUnixNano": "1706000000000000000"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "clamped": false
}
```

#### Get Workflow History

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/workflow-history
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "history": null,
  "isWorkflowEnabled": false
}
```

#### Summary

Get a full snapshot of the actor in a single request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6420/gateway/{actor_id}/inspector/summary
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "state": { "count": 42 },
  "connections": [],
  "rpcs": ["increment", "getCount"],
  "queueSize": 0,
  "isStateEnabled": true,
  "isDatabaseEnabled": false,
  "isWorkflowEnabled": false,
  "workflowHistory": null
}
```

### Polling

Inspector endpoints are safe to poll. For live monitoring, poll at 1-5 second intervals. The `/inspector/summary` endpoint is useful for periodic snapshots since it returns all data in a single request.

## OpenAPI Spec

The full OpenAPI specification including all management and actor endpoints is available:

- In the repository at [`rivetkit-openapi/openapi.json`](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/rivetkit-openapi)
- Served at `/doc` on the manager when running locally
